<h1 id="Research">Research</h1>

My research is primarily centered around our home Galaxy, the Milky Way. What would a biography of our Galaxy look like? How has our Galaxy grown and evolved over time, and what does that teach us about other galaxies like our own? I seek answers to these questions primarily by designing and analyzing large stellar spectroscopic surveys, and extensively use theoretical and simulation-based predictions to interpret observational findings. 

On this page I briefly summarize the major themes of my research, along with some representative publications that I've lead or co-lead. Projects on which I served as an advisor/mentor are highlighted with asterisks.

<h2 id="oh">The Galactic Outskirts</h2>

The furthest stars in the Milky Way -- to 100 kiloparsecs and beyond -- hold a treasure trove of information about the recent accretion history of our Galaxy, including the outsize perturbations from the in-falling Magellanic Clouds. 
As a central part of my PhD, I designed and executed a tailor-made spectroscopic survey to obtain detailed measurements of hundreds of these distant stars, building an all-sky dataset to understand the outer galaxy.

<h2 id="oh">The Evolution of the Milky Way</h2>

The Gaia space observatory has revolutionized our understanding of the Miky Way with 3D positions, velocities, and low-resolution spectroscopy of millions of stars. I have extensively worked on extracting scientific information from this rich dataset, and using its unprecedented size and fidelity to trace the formation history of our Galaxy.

<h2 id="oh">The Via Project</h2>

The [Via Project](https://github.com/via-project/) is an upcoming spectroscopic survey that will place twin high-resolution multi-object spectrographs on 6.5-meter telescopes covering both celestial hemispheres. I have played a central role in the Via project since it was first proposed, co-leading the science development and building software to simulate various aspects of the instrument and survey. I'm also involved in the opto-mechanical design of the ViaSpec instrument. 

<h2 id="oh">White Dwarf Stars</h2>

White dwarfs are compact stellar remnants left behind by all Sun-like stars. They are some of the best laboratories of general relativistic and quantum mechanical effects on macroscopic scales.
