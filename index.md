<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

I'm a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at [Harvard University](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/). I primarily work with Professor [Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy) as a part of the broader [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss5.org/) and [H3 Survey](http://h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) collaborations. I also work with [Hans-Walter Rix](https://www.mpia.de/rix) at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) on understanding the formation of the Milky Way. Recently, I've been involved with desigining the next-generation [Via spectroscopic survey and ViaSpec instrument](https://via-project.org/). 

I was an undergraduate at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), where I spent the vast majority of my time doing astrophysical research with Professor [Nadia Zakamska](https://zakamska.johnshopkins.edu/) and graduate student [Hsiang-Chih Hwang](http://www.hwang-astro.me). I was also a co-investigator at the [Johns Hopkins Human Spaceflight Lab](https://www.jhuhsl.space), where we ran human trials to evaluate the effects of long-term spaceflight. From 2020-2021, I was employed part-time at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu), where I developed tools to study star formation in nearby galaxies using space observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope. 

<h1 id="Research">Research</h1>

I'm interested in a wide range of research topics, a by-product of being easily distracted as a young child. I particularly enjoy working with large datasets to tease out answers to astrophysical problems. You can find an overview of my work on my [research page](https://vedantchandra.com/research), and more about my close collaborators [here](https://vedantchandra.com/friends). 

<h1 id="pub">Publications</h1>

A compilation of all my publications is available on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/frBgq47XRVm5Oy_ielR_6w) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eFbbm5UAAAAJ&hl=en).
