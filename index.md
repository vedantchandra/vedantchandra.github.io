<h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

I'm a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at [Harvard University](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/). I primarily work with Professor [Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy), studying the Milky Way as a part of the broader [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss5.org/) and [H3 Survey](http://h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) collaborations. During the summer, I work with [Hans-Walter Rix](https://www.mpia.de/rix) at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) to understand the structure and evolution of our galaxy. Since 2023, I've spent most of my time as the Deputy Project Scientist for the [Via Project](https://via-project.org/), designing and building the next-generation [ViaSpec](https://via-project.org/#/spectrographs/) instrument.

<h1 id="Research">Research</h1>

I'm interested in a wide range of research topics spanning observations, simulations, and instrumentation. A few key questions guide my work. 
+ How can we reconstruct the evolutionary history of our home galaxy, the Milky Way?
+ What are the structural and dynamical properties of the Milky Way on the largest scales, towards the distant horizon of the galaxy?
+ What is the physical nature of the 'dark matter' that binds and shapes all galaxies?

In practical terms, I primarily seek answers to these questions by designing, conducting, and analyzing stellar spectroscopic surveys. You can find an overview of my work and projects on my [research page](https://vedantchandra.com/research). 

<h1 id="pub">Publications</h1>

A compilation of all my publications is available on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/frBgq47XRVm5Oy_ielR_6w) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eFbbm5UAAAAJ&hl=en).
